/*
 * Thread groups
 * =============
 *
 * The threading code maintains separate pools of threads for each thread
 * group. Threads belonging to a common purpose should be created within the
 * same thread group. Thread groups are intended to ensure that the threading
 * resources are not exhausted for different purposes.
 *
 * For example, if you have a set of threads which can spawn new threads,
 * you want to ensure that the "mother" threads are in a separate thread
 * group than the "child" threads. This ensures that there is no dead-lock
 * scenario where the "child" threads exhaust all threading resources
 * not allowing a "mother" thread to be created to handle the "children".
 *
 * Special Thread Groups
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Special thread groups ensure that one thread per special thread
 * group is reserved. I.e. for the purpose of the special case, the
 * thread handler will not use such special thread for other purposes.
 *
 * NOTE: When using thread_start for such a special case, make sure to invoke
 *	 this function with the special thread group identifier.
 *
 * These identifiers should not collide with the "regular" group IDs which
 * start at 0.
 *
 * The ACVP_THREAD_MAX_SPECIAL_GROUPS specifies how many special threading
 * groups are available.
