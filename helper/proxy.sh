# Helper script to invoke the ACVP Proxy.
#
# This directory defines the IUT-specific information in order to invoke the
# ACVP Proxy. This script is intended to be copied into the separate folder
# where the IUT test information is kept.
#
# Steps how to use this script:
#
#	1. Copy this script to the directory where your IUT information shall
#	   be stored.
#	2. Update the variables below as needed
#	3. Fetch test vectors: invoke this script - ./proxy.sh get
#		-> Test vectors are stored under $TARGETDIR/testvectors
#	4. Upload responses stored in $TARGETDIR/testvectors to ACVP server and
#	   get verdicts - ./proxy.sh post
#	5. Publish IUT test round: invoke iteratively ./proxy.sh publish
#

#
# Directory where:
# 1. Testvectors are to be stored
# 2. Secure datastore is to be stored
# 3. (optionally) modules_defintions directory is used (if not present,
#    the modules_definitions directory from the home of the ACVP Proxy is used)
# 4. (optionally) modules_implementations directory is used - if this directory
#    is present and has a Makefile, the Makefile is invoked. If the Makefile is
#    not present, each *.so file is used as an ACVP Proxy extension
#
# Example:
#	TARGETDIR="/my/specific/IUT/path/acvpproxy"
#
TARGETDIR=${TARGETDIR:-"."}

# Specific directory for modules_defintions - if empty, $TARGETDIR is used
# automatically
TARGETDIR_MODDEF=${TARGETDIR_MODDEF:-""}

# Specific directory for modules_implementations - if empty, $TARGETDIR is used
# automatically
TARGETDIR_MODIMPL=${TARGETDIR_MODIMPL:-""}

# Specific directory for testvectors / testvectors-production - if empty,
# $TARGETDIR is used automatically
TARGETDIR_TESTVECTORS=${TARGETDIR_TESTVECTORS:-""}

# Specific directory for secure-datastore / secure-datastore-production - if
# empty, $TARGETDIR is used automatically
TARGETDIR_SECUREDATASTORE=${TARGETDIR_SECUREDATASTORE:-""}

#
# Development environment of ACVP Proxy: point to the directory where either
# the ACVP sources are found or at least the ACVP Proxy header files.
#
# This variable must only be set if the ACVP Proxy binary distribution
# generated is not installed and referenced by PROXYBINPATH
#
# Example:
#	PROXYCODEPATH="$HOME/my/ACVP/source/code/directory"
#
PROXYCODEPATH=${PROXYCODEPATH:-""}

#
# Specify the ACVP Proxy version. This is used as a sanity check in case the
# ACVP Proxy binary is updated. To set this variable, invoke the following
# command and copy its result into this variable.
#
#	acvp-proxy --version-numeric
#
# Example:
#	PROXYVERSION="1020000"
#
PROXYVERSION=${PROXYVERSION:-"1070800"}

#
# Specify the ACVP search parameters if needed. As documented with the ACVP
# Proxy, the search scope is vital to ensure the ACVP Proxy only operates on
# the intended IUT definitions.
#
# The entire search string that is used on the command line is to be applied
# here. Note, a string is quoted with single quotes, if needed. If no search
# scope is needed, all IUT definitions known to the ACVP Proxy are used.
#
# To verify the correctness of the search scope, you may execute this script
# as follows:
#	./proxy.sh list
#
# Example:
#	PROXYSEARCH="-m 'My IUT(R) Name (64bit)' -e 'Specific CPU'"
#
PROXYSEARCH=${PROXYSEARCH:-""}

#
# Directory where the ACVP Proxy is located. Commonly the ACVP Proxy is
# found in this directory. It is permissible that the ACVP Proxy binary is
# symlinked in that directory.
#
# Note: This directory expects also the acvpproxy_conf.json and
#	acvpproxy_conf_production.json configuration files. It is permissible
#	to have symlinks to those files there.
#
# Note 2: If the ACVP Proxy binary distribution along with the ACVP Proxy
#	  header files are deployed in that directory, no ACVP Proxy source
#	  code is needed.
#
# Note 3: It is permissible to unpack the ACVP Proxy binary distribution into
#	  this directory to have it found automatically. This allows the
#	  parallel installation of multiple different ACVP Proxy binary
#	  distributions (one for each version) where the right binary
#	  distribution is used depending on the settion of PROXYVERSION
#
# Example:
#	PROXYBINPATH="$HOME/bin"
#
PROXYBINPATH=${PROXYBINPATH:-"$HOME/bin"}
